    1) Contents of unzipped Homework 1 file:
        - FeistelCipher.py: source code for Project feistel cipher
        - message.txt: Original text to be encrypted
        - ciphertext.txt: Results of encryption of message.txt after running Project.py
        - ciphertext_bits.txt: Helper text used for decrypting ciphertext.txt back to message.txt content
        - decrypt.txt: Result of decryption of ciphertext put here to compare with original message.txt

    2) change directory to Homework 1 directory (cd ./Homework\1)
        in the location you have done extraction of zip file

    3) On commandline write "python Project1.py"
        Note: The message.txt file is already used wihtin Project.py and ciphertext.txt is generated within code but the results from my simulations
            are added to show that the results prove my code works.

    4) On commandline you should see text "You have successfully encrypted and decrypted back to original file content!!!"
        which indicates that you have run the feistel encryption and decryption successfully.
