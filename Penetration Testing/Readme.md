Project file contents:

    -pentest.py: the file for penetration testing
    -Screenshot directory with 8 screenshots from the tests that I have implemented
    -7 already existing .dat files from my previously run tests.

Steps to running the project:

    1) Open the zip file and then cd ./Project2
    2) Type into the command line: chmod +x pentest.py
    3) Type into the command line: sudo python3 pentest.py
    4) Main menu will come up with information on what type of tests you want to run.
    5) Start off in order of 1-10 to get the most out of the test!

*Note:
    -In the pentest.py testing environment the tests #8 & 10 run and then have problems with returning back to the main menu because ctrl-z or ctrl-c needs to be used to return which kicks you out of the program. So, you will need to run fill again but do not worry the information you have gathered until now is safely appended within the .dat files as you run.
    -You will need to download scapy, nmap, wireshark, and tabulate (python module) to run this project succesfully.
    -Bash scripting is used to implement nmap codes from python thus Unix support is necessary to also run the project!
